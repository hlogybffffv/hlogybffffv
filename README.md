Enhancements for admins bypassing branch protections on github.com
April 20, 2023
branchespoliciesrepositoriesrules
When editing a file on github.com, repo admins, actors with the bypass branch protections permissions, and actors in bypass lists on branch protections will now default to creating a new branch instead for directly committing. You can still commit directly to a protected branch, but doing so will add notifications in-line highlighting that some rules will be bypassed.

Fixed bug that allowed a hovercard URL to be used to display the name, description, and star count of any repository
April 17, 2023
repositoriessecurity
On March 30, 2023, we fixed a bug that allowed a dependency graph hovercard URL to be used to retrieve the name, description, and star count of any repository on GitHub.com. The bug was introduced on March 28, 2023 and our investigation has found no evidence of exploitation. To exploit the bug, a specific header needed to be set when making a request to the URL and the numeric ID of a repository provided. The URL would then return the HTML content designed to be used for a hovercard UI element with the repository name, description, and star count in the response.

Organize Discussions Categories into Sections
April 17, 2023
categoriesdiscussionsorganizesections
Since the introduction of Category Sections to organize content in our own community, users have asked for similar features to organize their own Discussions. Today, we're introducing the ability for all maintainers to group their Discussion categories into sections. We think this will help users better organize content, and also find new content more easily.

Marking a threaded comment as the answer

githubdiscussionsmoderationq&a
When we introduced GitHub Discussions in 2020, we allowed users to mark an answer to a question in the "Q&A" Discussions category. As the feature began getting more usage, we noticed that often, the real answer to a question may live in a reply to an answer. Today, we are introducing the ability for users to mark a threaded reply as the answer to a question.

Automatic rebases on Dependabot pull requests stop after 30 days of inactivity
April 13, 2023
dependabotsecurity-and-compliance
When changes in a repository make a Dependabot pull request out-of-date, Dependabot will automatically rebase it so that it is able to be merged without your manual effort. With this release, if a PR has not been merged for 30 days, Dependabot will stop rebasing it and will include a note about this in the PR body. You will still be able to manually rebase and merge the pull request. We've heard your feedback about Dependabot noisiness and are making Dependabot quieter and more focused on repositories you care about. For enterprise customers, this improvement has the added benefit of enhanced efficiency with your self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. For Enterprise Server customers, this update will be available to you in GHES 3.10.

Dependabot now supports fetching release notes and changelogs for Docker images
April 13, 2023
dependabotsecurity-and-compliance
You can now fetch release notes, changelogs and commit history for Docker update pull requests with Dependabot. This will allow you to quickly evaluate the stability risk of the dependency upgrade. To enable support, add the org.opencontainers.image.source label to the Dockerfile with the URL of the source repository. Additionally, the repository should be tagged with the same tags as the published Docker images. This allows Dependabot to understand which repo and commit is associated each version/tag of a Docker image. Here's an example repository demonstrating this setup.
